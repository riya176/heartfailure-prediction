# heartfailure-prediction
 On this report,I visualize the distribution of the variables in the Heart Failure Prediction dataset and explore their relationship with the target variable DEATH_EVENT.
 Based on the result of this analysis, I define several machine learning models to compare their performance on this dataset to predict the target variable using the most correlated subset of variables from the dataset.
